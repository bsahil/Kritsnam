# Kritsnam
## This Readme File along with the Internship report(//Internship report link yet to be added) combined is supposed to act as the final Internship Report, as asked of me by my internship supervisor. 
#### Work done during kritsnam

1. Communication with [ESP32](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/hardware/esp32/overview) using micropython.
 * Complete setup of `I2C` and `UART` protocol with ESP32 flashing both `Micropython` and `Arduino` one by one.
 * Sent and recieved data using these protocols with different sensors of interests, including Temperature, Soil Moisture and Dissolved 
Oxygen sensors by [Atlas Scientific](https://www.atlas-scientific.com/).
 
2. Overall understanding and testing of all ESP32 board functionalities.
 * Operation of ESP32 using `WIFI`, `Bluetooth` module embedded onboard.
 * Sent and recieved data to and from an online open source server facility provided by [Thingsboard](https://thingsboard.io/).
 * Integration of data from different sensors and `sending it to Thingsboard server` to view and utilize data on cloud from anywhere where data connectivity is available.


3. Completed Device Prototype by mid-June.
 * Prototype was up and functioning with `‘4’ i2c-sensors` and one `“one-wire” temperature sensor “ds18b20”` attached to it.
 
4. Undertook `PCB designing` for the actual product.
 * Used `Kicad` for PCB-designing.
 * Learnt PCB-designing for a week.
 * Made custum libraries of schematic and footprints for the project by the end of June. 
[Libraries available here](https://github.com/bsahil/Kritsnam/tree/master/PCB-Design).
 * Completed Footprint and Schematic of PCB by 5th of July.
 * Sent PCB to printing.

5. 

covering has to be made which is to be used to market our product.
User interface of the device has to be decided.
Additional peripherals can be added to minimise human skill requirement in the process of data collection.
